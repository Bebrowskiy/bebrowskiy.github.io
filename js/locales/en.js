    "about.text1": "My journey into code began with a humble YouTube tutorial on building a calculator – a classic tale of curiosity sparked by simplicity. Since then, I've evolved into a developer who thrives on projects that genuinely excite me. I'm not just here for the paycheck (okay, maybe a little for the coffee fund!), but for that spark of inspiration that turns an idea into reality.",
    "about.text2": "I'm the kind of developer who sees code as a form of poetry – sometimes elegant, sometimes a beautiful mess. Motivation hits me like a muse, and I chase ideas with the fervor of a true enthusiast. When I'm not lost in lines of Python, you'll find me immersed in music, which is as essential to my process as any IDE.",
    "about.text3": "My toolkit? Python is my trusty companion, and I'm comfortable dancing between Flask/Django backends and crafting amazing frontends. I automate the mundane, build quirky projects, and occasionally wrestle with legacy code (it's all part of the adventure!). I code, I coffee, I create – and I definitely debug... a lot.",
